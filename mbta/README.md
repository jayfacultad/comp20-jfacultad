Assignment 2 Closest MBTA Station  

All aspects of the word have been correctly implemented:  
- Map takes up the entire page.
- Each station on the map is represented as a custom marker.
- Initially, the map is centered on South Station.
- Red polyline connects each station, including Ashmost branch.
- User's geolocation is determined and represented by a marker different than the station markers.
- The map centers on the user's location automatically.
- Upon clicking the user's geolocation on the map, an information window appears that displays the closest MBTA station, including distance away in miles.
- Black polyline connect's the user's geolocation marker to the marker of the closest MBTA station when the user's geolocation is clicked.
- Upon clicking on a station marker, an information window appears that displays the associate station's schedule of upcoming trains and train directions.  

No incorrectly implemented aspects have been identified.  

I spoke to Jian Wei about this assignment, specifically on the ways to display the parsed JSON objects.  

Approximately 14 hours was spent complething the assignment.
