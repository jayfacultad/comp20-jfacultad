- What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)  
The purpose of this Git repository is to store lab and class assignments for COMP20 fall 2018.
- What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?  
My favorite assignment is Assignment 2 because it incorporated the previous 5 labs and allowed me to take a deep dive into the Document Object Model, API's, JSON format, Javascript, event listeners, among many other topics. It felt rewarding to deploy an actual working web app that incorporates many different concepts. It was a great project to understand where and how apps and utilities I personally use (such as Google Maps and an app for the MBTA schedule) obtain their information and the work that goes on under the hood to display the data because I use public transportation everyday.
- How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?  
I feel I have grown enormously from day 1 to now because I feel confident using the tools and concepts related to web development. I had no prior knowledge or experience before coming to class, and I greatly appreciate understanding how clients and servers work via the request/response model.
- What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.  
The most important thing, I believe, is the communication process between clients and servers and how the data is packaged and transmitted between them. The diagrams that Ming regularly draws in class really solidifies the concepts well.
- Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?  
I would like to delve deeper into mobile web app development.
