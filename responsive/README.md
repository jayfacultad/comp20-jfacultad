Lab 4 Responsive Design

All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.  The image changes
depending on the width of the browser window.  No incorrectly implented 
aspect was identified.

I utilized online resources to learn more about using sprites and media 
queries for responsive design.  I did not collaborate with any individuals
for this assignment.

Approximately 1.5 hous was spent completing the assignment.
